Getting started to writing my own browser extension for dark theme in web pages displayed by Google Chrome.<br />
The extension just makes the background black in color and text white in color.(The links still remain as they are.Since links are blue generally, they already suit the dark theme).<br />
Color of headings not taken care of.(To be updated) <br />
